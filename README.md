Hello world! This is another fun project that I made. This is also my first machine learning project. It is a simple and fan made replica of the matchmaking software of Love Solutions company from How I Met Your Mother. It takes name, age, gender and some personal interests as parameters, and finds the nearest partner using Euclidian distance and K-Nearest-Neighbours. Note that this results may or may not be real and this should only be used for fun. The biggest difference from real one is, I don't guarantee %100 success rate :) To get your records added to the list, you can e-mail me at contact@alphard.tk with details. Hope you enjoy!
